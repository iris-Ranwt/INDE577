# Unsupervised Learning 

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns patterns and relationships in data without explicit guidance or supervision from a human. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given a dataset without labeled outcomes, and it must find structure in the data on its own.

Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm is given a labeled dataset and learns to predict labels for new data, unsupervised learning is used to find hidden patterns or relationships within the data itself. Unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD).

Unsupervised learning is often used in exploratory data analysis, data mining, and pattern recognition applications. It is a powerful tool for discovering underlying patterns and insights in large and complex datasets that may not be immediately apparent to a human observer.
