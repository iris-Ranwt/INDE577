# K-means

K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm, meaning that it does not require labeled data to train. It is commonly used in data mining, pattern recognition, and image analysis, among other fields. One of the advantages of K-means is its simplicity and efficiency, which makes it suitable for large data sets. However, it has some limitations, such as the sensitivity to the initial centroids and the assumption of the clusters having a spherical shape and equal sizes.

## Dataset Description 

### Overview
We would use dataset of penguin from kaggle in this assignment and performing the decision tree:
The main importent variables in the datasets are:  
We would use penguin data to illustrate the method.
The dataset contain 8 variables: 
1. species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
2. culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
3. culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
5. body_mass_g: body mass (g)
6. island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in thePalmer. 
7. Archipelago (Antarctica) sex: penguin sex
8. The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak”.
