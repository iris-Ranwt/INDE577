# Perceptron 

A perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that models the behavior of a single neuron. It is a simple algorithm that can be used for supervised learning of binary classifiers, meaning it can learn to classify input data into one of two possible classes.


## Dataset Description 

### Overview
We would use dataset of penguin from kaggle in this assignment and performing the decision tree:
The main importent variables in the datasets are:  
We would use penguin data to illustrate the method.
The dataset contain 8 variables: 
1. species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
2. culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
3. culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
5. body_mass_g: body mass (g)
6. island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in thePalmer. 
7. Archipelago (Antarctica) sex: penguin sex
8. The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak”.
