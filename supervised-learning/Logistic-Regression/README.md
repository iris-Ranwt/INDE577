# Logistic Regression 

## Objectives

In this part we would discuss about logistic regression. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning for classification problems. It is a statistical method used to analyze a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). 

## Dataset Description 
We would use a penguins dataset from kaggle to demonstrate.

The dataset contain 8 variables: 
1. species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
2. culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
3. culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
5. body_mass_g: body mass (g)
6. island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in thePalmer. 
7. Archipelago (Antarctica) sex: penguin sex
8. The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak”.
