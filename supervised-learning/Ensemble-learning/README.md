# Ensemble_Learning 

## Objectives

In this part we would discuss about ensemle learning. Ensemble learning is a technique in machine learning where multiple models are combined to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble learning uses a collection of models that work together to provide a more accurate prediction.  
We would also talk about random forest, which is a collection of decision trees by  sampleing without replacement, in this jupyter notebook. 

## Dataset Description 
We would use a penguins dataset from kaggle to demonstrate.

The dataset contain 8 variables: 
1. species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
2. culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
3. culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
4. flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
5. body_mass_g: body mass (g)
6. island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in thePalmer. 
7. Archipelago (Antarctica) sex: penguin sex
8. The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak”.
