## Objectives

In this part we would discuss about decision tree. A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

## Data
We would use dataset:_______________________  in this assignment.
