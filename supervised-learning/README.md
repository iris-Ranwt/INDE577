# Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns to predict an output variable (also known as a dependent variable) from an input variable (also known as an independent variable) based on a training dataset consisting of labeled examples.

In other words, supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled data where the desired output is already known. The algorithm is trained on this data to find patterns and relationships between the input and output variables. Once the algorithm has learned these patterns, it can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Supervised learning is commonly used in applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Some popular algorithms used in supervised learning include decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
