# Linear Regression 

## Objectives

In this part we would discuss about linear regression. Linear regression is a popular supervised learning algorithm in machine learning that is used to predict a continuous numerical value (also known as the target variable or response variable) based on one or more input variables (also known as independent variables or predictors).The goal of linear regression is to find a linear relationship between the input variables and the target variable. 

## Data
we would use insurance dataset from kaggle to illustrate. 
age: age of primary beneficiary

* sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male  
* bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9   
* children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents  
* smoker: Smoking  
* region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. 
* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
